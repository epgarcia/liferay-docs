# Targeting Content To Your Audience [](id=targeting-content-to-your-audience)

Audience Targeting provides tools to divide your audience into user segments, 
target specific content to different user segments, and create campaigns for 
different user segments. You can also quickly measure the effectiveness of your 
campaigns. User segments are configured to display different assets to 
different users. Campaigns display specific content to different user segments 
for fixed periods of time, and measure the interaction of the targeted user 
segments with the chosen content.

You can use Audience Targeting to display one set of advertisements to one user 
segment and another set of advertisements to another user segment, and this can 
dynamically change every week based on your marketing goals. Or you can display 
news articles to users based on all the user segments to which they belong. 
 
With Liferay's Audience Targeting app, available from [Liferay Marketplace](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace),
developers can easily create additional rules and rule types
with minimal coding efforts. Audience Targeting also allows you to create campaigns that target specific user segments. Campaigns last for fixed
periods of time and each campaign has a priority that determines which
campaign takes precedence, and you can configure different assets to
be displayed at different periods of time to the targeted user segment.
 
The Audience Targeting App adds an *Audience Targeting* section to the
Configuration section of the Site Administration area of the Menu and a User
Segments Simulator to the Simulation Menu. The following three applications are
also included with the Audience Targeting app:

- Campaign Content Display
- User Segment Content Display
- User Segment Content List

You can add these applications to any @product@ page. In the next sections,
you'll lean how to use the *Audience Targeting* section of the Site
Administration area to manage user segments and campaigns. Then you'll learn how
to use each of the Audience Targeting applications and the Audience Targeting
Simulator.
